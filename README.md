Initialization: The contract initializes with no specific setup needed in the init function.

Upgrade Endpoint (upgradeCitizenToSoldier):

Users send 5 "GOLD" and 5 "ORE" tokens to upgrade a "Citizen" NFT to a "Soldier" NFT.
The contract verifies that the correct amounts of tokens are sent and burns them.
NFT Verification and Upgrade:

The verify_and_upgrade_nft function checks if the caller owns the specified NFT.
It then upgrades the NFT using the dyNFT feature, which involves modifying the NFT's metadata to reflect the new rank.
dyNFT Feature:

The upgrade_nft_metadata function is a placeholder representing the logic to change NFT metadata. Implementing this requires interacting with dyNFT capabilities, allowing dynamic updates to NFT properties.
Security and Usability:

Ensure the contract is tested thoroughly to handle various edge cases.
The contract should be open-sourced to allow for community verification and auditing.
